## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher) installed on your machine

- MongoDB database running

## Installation Steps
1. Clone the Twitch Stellar Tipbot GitHub repository to your local machine:
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the dependencies using npm or yarn ``npm install``
4. Setup a `.env` file in the root of the project directory. You can use the provided `sample.env` file as a template. Update the following variables in the .env file with your own values:
```
BOT_WELCOME_MESSAGE=""

TWITCH_USERNAME=""
TWITCH_PASSWORD="oauth:PASSWORD"
TWITCH_CHANNELS=""

ACCESS_TOKEN=""
REFRESH_TOKEN=""
CLIENT_ID=""

DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017"
DATABASE_NAME=""

WALLET_ADDRESS=""
WALLET_KEY=""

ENVIRONMENT="dev"

CLIENT_APP_ID=""
CLIENT_APP_SECRET=""
```
5. Create a `tokens.js` file in the config directory. You can use the provided `tokens.sample.js` file as a template.
```
{
    XLM: {
        asset_code: "",
        asset_issuer: ""
    },
    USDC: {
        asset_code: "",
        asset_issuer: "",
    }
}
```
6. Make sure your MongoDB database is up and running. Update the `DATABASE_URL` variable in the `.env` file with the connection URI for your MongoDB database.
7. Start the tipbot server: ```npm start ``` or ```node server.js ```

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the Twitch Stellar Tipbot on your server. The bot is now ready to accept tips in the allowed tokens on the Twitch channel specified in the `.env` file.

Note: Make sure to keep your `.env` file and tokens.js file secure and do not share them publicly, as they contain sensitive information such as your Twitch bot's OAuth token and your Stellar account keys.
